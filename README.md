# DynamicTrafficAssignment.jl
A Julia package for solving dynamic traffic assignment problems.

I have already written a Python scripts for solving user-equilibrium DTA problems, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/SaiKiran92/DTAnx). I think it can be done better with Julia. Planning to do it before July. In the meanwhile, you can also checkout my [package for Static traffic assignment problems](https://github.com/SaiKiran92/StaticTrafficAssignment.jl).
